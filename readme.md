## Predicting sexual discrim

I use Harvard University data on implicit discrimiation to spot predictors of sexual discrimiation (exploratory analysis and machine learning). The fig. shows variables correlated (OLS exploratory regression) with implicit discrimination.

### Files: 
- data_prep: data cleaning and data preparation
- data_modeling: EDA and ML modeling
- Sexuality_IAT.public.2020.sav and Sexuality_IAT.public.2021.sav: row data
- df_ready: data cleaned (ready for modeling)
- docs_files contains information on the variables
