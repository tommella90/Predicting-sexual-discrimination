# IMPLICIT SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION
**Notebook [here](https://github.com/tommella90/Predicting-sexual-discrimination/blob/main/analysis.ipynb)**

## DESCRIPTION
I use the Harvard test IAT to explore potential predictors of implicit sexual discrimination. The IAT association test is a cognitive test used to measure implicit discrimination through associatons (e.g.: associate good/bad inputs with gay/straight inputs) as time reactions.

## RESEARCH QUESTION
Which individual characteristics predict implicit sexual discrimination? The IAT tests asks the respondents to fill some information about their believes, politics orientations, explicit discrimination and so on. I use these information to predict the measure of implicit discrimination (time reaction to the association test).
I used linear regression to explore feature importance, as shown in the figure.
